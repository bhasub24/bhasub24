# Hi, I'm Bharath ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Master's student and researcher interested in building intelligent systems that advance both human and machine capabilities. My work blends learning theory, inference, and real-world applications â€” from computational imaging to reinforcement learning. Previously a software engineer at Deloitte, I now focus on creating technologies that empower people and amplify understanding.
